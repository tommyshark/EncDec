# EncDec
GUI for encrypting and decrypting text using different methods, such as Base, URL and in the future even more.

A Linux Python program for quick and easy text encryption and decryption using different methods. 
Not many methods have been added so far, but the project will evolve.
This can be useful when you need to quickly and without lags encrypt a small text or decrypt it, instead of writing in the terminal manually or going to a website.
